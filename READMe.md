# Practice 3

## Specifications

- Form a team of 3 to 4 people
- With the corpus of news generated in practice II, perform the following:
  1. Load the corpus
  2. Generate the three vector representations reviewed in class (frequency, binarized, and tf-idf)
- Select a new text document as input and indicate the type of vector representation. Do the following with this document:
  1. Apply the same normalization process performed with the news corpus
  2. Generate the indicated vector representation
  3. Apply the cosine similarity algorithm to determine the similarity between the input document and the rest of the documents in the news corpus.
  4. Display the 10 most similar documents in descending order

## Interface

An interface with the following specifications needs to be created for the practice:

- The news corpus should be uploaded, and the three distinct text representations must be generated.
- The program must enable the user to select a test file by indicating the file name (and path) or using a browse button in a graphical interface.
- The program should display the 10 most similar documents in descending order.
